Assignment 1: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
Objectives:
1. Understand the basic concepts of OOP, such as objects, classes, attributes, and methods.
2. Explore the benefits of OOP, including modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
3. Compare OOP with procedural programming.
Instructions:
1. Creating a Class and Objects
a. Define a class named Car that has the following attributes:
brand (string)
model (string)
year (integer)
mileage (integer)
b. Create an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.
c. Define a method called display_info() that prints the details of the car in a readable
format.
d. Create three different objects of the Car class (e.g., representing three different cars)
and call the display_info() method for each.
2. Methods and Object Behavior
a. Add a new method called drive() to the Car class that:
Takes a parameter distance (integer).
Adds distance to the mileage attribute.
b. Update the display_info() method to include the updated mileage after the car is
driven.
c. Create an object of the Car class, call the drive() method with a distance of 100, and
then display the updated information of the car.
3. Benefits of OOP
a. Create a new class named ElectricCar that inherits from the Car class. Add the
following attributes:
battery_capacity (integer, in kWh)
charge_level (integer, percentage)
b. Define a method charge() that takes a parameter amount (integer) and adds this
amount to charge_level, ensuring that the charge level does not exceed 100%.
c. Write a brief explanation (4-5 sentences) on how the ElectricCar class demonstrates
the principles of modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
4. Comparison of OOP and Procedural Programming
a. Rewrite the Car functionality (from Task 1) using a procedural programming approach.
b. Answer the following questions:
What differences did you notice between the OOP and procedural implementations?
How does OOP provide benefits like modularity, reusability, and maintainability
compared to procedural programming?
Submission:
1. Submit your Python code in a .py file.
2. Write the explanation in Task 3c and the answers for Task 4b as comments in your
Python code.
